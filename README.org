Study Emacs [[http://orgmode.org][Org Mode]] files with [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition][spaced repetition]].

Spaced repetition is a useful tool for memorizing content. But most
spaced repetition software divides knowledge into atomic flashcards
that aren't synchronized with notes. This extension to Org Mode
provides annotations for studying notes directly. Parts of a file are
marked for study by an unobtrusive annotation.

Right now, only simple fill-in-the-blank questions with a single
answer are supported.

The spaced repetition algorithm I use is based on the flashcard
program [[http://ankisrs.net/][anki]].
