* Explanation
Study Emacs [[http://orgmode.org][Org Mode]] files with [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition][spaced repetition]].

Most spaced repetition software (SRS), including [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-drill.html][org-drill.el]], drills the user
on atomic facts divided into flashcards. The idea behind org-study.el is to
embed flashcards directly into notes or study materials as unobtrusively as
possible, so that passive and active recall can be part of the same study
session, and flashcard creation is a natural part of note-taking.

Right now, only simple fill-in-the-blank questions with a single
answer and multiple choice questions are supported.

The spaced repetition algorithm I use is based on the SRS [[http://ankisrs.net/][anki]].

To use, put this in your init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/org-study")
  (require 'org-study)
#+END_SRC
* To do list
** TODO BUG: [*does/doesn't]
** TODO study stamp at a numbered list should hide the rest of the list
** TODO better cards types
Rewrite the system for defining cards types to be more general and easy to
understand
** TODO depend on org-learn.el
There is already a spaced-repetition extension for org-mode, and I should borrow
the algorithm from that instead of recreating it
** TODO store flashcard data better
Flashcard scheduling data is stored inline like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  STUDY{[2015-07-22 Wed],130,130 }
#+END_EXAMPLE

Although font-lock can collapse it into one character this is not ideal

Look at org-archive for undoable operations involving other files

And it looks like the current scheduling algorithm isn't quite right

** TODO integrate with org-agenda
** TODO hints
** TODO work with org-toggle-time-stamp-overlays
